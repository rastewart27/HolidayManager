Order of Attack:
 main()
 HolidayList()
 Holiday()
 First, step:
  Allow the json file to work.
  Once json file works, attack webscraping
 Things to pay attention to:
  __init__ in Holiday has no pseudo code
  maybe we just turn it into a dataclass and don't bother?
  Week calculation, does datatime have a function for that?
  Still not super comfy with json importing, but once it's in easy to
    work with.


First Pass before initial github upload:
 - Initialize object
 - Load JSON file
 - menu loop
 - Display menu -> store text in another file?
 - user input and error checking .strip().lower()[0] isnumeric() isalpha()
 
Second Pass:
 - touching up menu functions
 - testing menu functions

Third Pass:
 - webscraping
 - double check date features

Fourth Pass:
 - Weather API
 - Test edge cases
 - Submit.

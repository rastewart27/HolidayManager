As could potentially be expected, the code is centered on main.py
main.py does most of the importing and the entire code should be able to be run from main.py

Note:
 You need the python package bs4 for beautiful soup in order to use the web scraping portion

 Appears that there was a several hour delay before your key is activated.  Also used timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ for all the holidays 
 that are observed.  Don't call from that website too often as they will IP block you if they feel that you have accessed their site too much recently.
